Group meeting schedule, Fall 2021

Mondays 3-4pm, second floor meeting room in building 90 (SICCS).

1. your research.
2. somebody else's paper.
3. some useful software.

- Aug 16: Toby, Talk 1: [[file:2021-08-15-research-projects.org][How I organize my research projects]]. Talk 2:
  [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdhock/functional-pruning-theory/master/HOCKING-recent-advances.pdf][Recent advances in supervised optimal changepoint detection]].
  Abstract: Changepoint detection involves detecting abrupt changes in
  data sequences measured over space or time. Although there are many
  classical unsupervised algorithms for this problem, several of my
  recent research projects have involved proposing new supervised
  labeling methods and optimization algorithms. In this talk I will
  give an overview of these recent advances, with a discussion of
  applications in various problem domains (medicine, genomics,
  neuroscience).
