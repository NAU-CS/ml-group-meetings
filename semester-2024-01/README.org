- Jan 16: Toby, Title: [[https://github.com/tdhock/mlr3resampling][mlr3resampling]]: cross-validation algorithms for
  the mlr3 framework in R. Abstract: cross-validation is an essential
  algorithm in any machine learning analysis. The mlr3 framework in R
  provides a standard interface to several common machine learning
  algorithms, including "standard" K-Fold cross-validation via
  =mlr3::ResamplingCV=. In this talk I will discuss two other kinds of
  K-fold cross-validation that I have implemented in the
  mlr3resampling R package. First, "Same versus Other"
  cross-validation can be used to determine the extent to which you
  can get accurate predictions, by training on some different data
  subset/group (person, image, geographic region, year, etc). Second,
  "Variable Size Train Set" cross-validation can be used to determine
  how many train set samples are necessary to get optimal prediction
  accuracy on the test set. [[https://github.com/tdhock/necromass/blob/main/HOCKING-slides-2024-01-12-berkeley.pdf][Slides]], [[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/mlr3resampling/vignettes/ResamplingSameOtherCV.html][Vignette]]

  - Presenter: Tung L.Nguyen
  - I am presenting: My research
  - Title: Optimizing Changepoint Detection through Deep Learning-based Penalty Tuning
  - Abstract: This study focuses on improving ChangePoint detection algorithms (OPART and LOPART), by dynamically learning the optimal penalty parameter, lambda. My approach aims to minimize predicted label errors using advanced deep learning methods. Comparative analysis against established methods like Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Linear techniques reveals the superiority of my proposed approach in terms of accuracy. This research contributes to enhancing the adaptability and effectiveness of ChangePoint detection algorithms for improved anomaly detection in time-series data.
