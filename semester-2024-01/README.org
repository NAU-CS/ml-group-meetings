- Jan 16: Toby, Title: [[https://github.com/tdhock/mlr3resampling][mlr3resampling]]: cross-validation algorithms for
  the mlr3 framework in R. Abstract: cross-validation is an essential
  algorithm in any machine learning analysis. The mlr3 framework in R
  provides a standard interface to several common machine learning
  algorithms, including "standard" K-Fold cross-validation via
  =mlr3::ResamplingCV=. In this talk I will discuss two other kinds of
  K-fold cross-validation that I have implemented in the
  mlr3resampling R package. First, "Same versus Other"
  cross-validation can be used to determine the extent to which you
  can get accurate predictions, by training on some different data
  subset/group (person, image, geographic region, year, etc). Second,
  "Variable Size Train Set" cross-validation can be used to determine
  how many train set samples are necessary to get optimal prediction
  accuracy on the test set.
