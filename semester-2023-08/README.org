   - Title: Using the NAU Monsoon super computer cluster for research.
   - Abstract: Monsoon is a super computer cluster which gives 4000
     CPUs to NAU researchers (including graduate students) for free
     use. In this talk I will explain how to use it for computational
     research, using examples from my NSF POSE project about expanding
     the open-source ecosystem around R data.table. First, NAU Monsoon
     was used to implement a daily report that summarizes reverse
     dependency check issues for R data.table, which simplifies
     release management since data.table developers no longer have to
     do these time-consuming results on their personal computers
     (compiling nightly R-devel + checking more than 1400
     packages). Second, NAU Monsoon was also used to implement
     asymptotic benchmarks for CSV read/write functions, which allowed
     identifying and fixing performance bugs in base R (quadratic time
     reduced to linear time).

LLNL postdoc [[https://kowshikthopalli.github.io/][Kowshik Thopalli]] <thopalli1@llnl.gov> invited talk Title: Improving Out-of-distribution Generalization of Deep Vision Models: Test-time and Train-time Adaptation Strategies. Abstract: This talk will focus on understanding and improving the robustness of deep vision models when training and testing data are drawn from different distributions To overcome this challenge, a common protocol has emerged, which involves adapting models at test-time with limited target data.  I will first discuss a novel “align then adapt” approach that effectively exploits latent space to adapt models without requiring access to source data. This method is highly effective across multiple architectures, complex distributions shifts, and modalities. However, in cases where extremely limited target data is available, test-time approaches may fail. I will consider the extreme case where only one target reference sample is available and present our efforts in designing effective generative augmentation protocol that involves finetuning a generator with single-shot data and developing a source-free adaptation protocol with the synthetic data. Finally, in certain practical scenarios test-time adaption can be cumbersome and often we don’t have access to any target data. To address this, I will present a train-time protocol that utilizes data from multiple source domains to build generalizable computer vision models through a novel meta-learning paradigm.  This approach is theoretically motivated and achieves excellent performance on more than 6 different datasets compared to a several state-of-the-art baselines. Thus, through this talk, I will present a suite of techniques to improve the out-of-distribution generalization of models for various computer vision tasks.
