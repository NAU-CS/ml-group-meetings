- Sep 9: Toby, Title: Time complexity analysis of recently proposed
  algorithms for optimal changepoint detection. Slides:
  https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegFPOP-paper/blob/master/2022-09-28-tucson-slides.pdf
  Abstract: Several dynamic programming algorithms have been recently
  proposed for efficiently solving various problems related to optimal
  changepoint detection in large data sequences measured over space or
  time. In this talk we will discuss three recent papers which each
  provide a theoretical or empirical time complexity analysis. Our
  time complexity analysis shows that these linear and log-linear time
  algorithms can be used for analysis of huge data sequences, with ten
  million observations or more, which are now common in areas such as
  genomics.
