- Sep 9: Toby, Title: Time complexity analysis of recently proposed
  algorithms for optimal changepoint detection. Slides:
  https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegFPOP-paper/blob/master/2022-09-28-tucson-slides.pdf
  Abstract: Several dynamic programming algorithms have been recently
  proposed for efficiently solving various problems related to optimal
  changepoint detection in large data sequences measured over space or
  time. In this talk we will discuss three recent papers which each
  provide a theoretical or empirical time complexity analysis. Our
  time complexity analysis shows that these linear and log-linear time
  algorithms can be used for analysis of huge data sequences, with ten
  million observations or more, which are now common in areas such as
  genomics.
- Sep 16: Daniel, Title: *Ghana and me*. This is a presentation about myself and the culture of the West Arican country, Ghana. Slides:     https://github.com/EngineerDanny/microbe-network-research/raw/main/Fall-2022/week-1/Ghana-and-me.pptx. My second presentation will be about the research paper "Network Analysis Methods for studying microbial communities : A mini review".

- Sep 23: Kyle
- Sep 30: Jadon, Title: /Optimizing Looping ROC Curves/. We’ll discuss Area Under ROC Curves, and showcase how real world data can lead to loops within our ROC curves. We will also go over a surrogate loss function for AUC, called Area Under Min(FP, FN) (AUM), that we can use to optimize these looping ROC curves. Finally, we’ll look at ongoing research for efficient AUM optimization: replacing the quadratic time exact line search with a log-linear time approximation.
